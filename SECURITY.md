# Security Policy
*Please Read before reporting a Security Issue!*

### __Reporting Security Issues__:
Security issues may be reported to our management team privately e.g. on Discord. Note that this applies _only_ to security issues; everything else should still be posted to issue tracker.

Publicly posting security issues is also allowed, because not everyone has or wants a Discord account. We may add other channels for private reports in future.

### __Team Guidelines__:
Everyone with push access must use two-factor authentication for their Github accounts. Should their account still be compromised, other team members should be immediately notified via Discord.

### __Browser Support__:
